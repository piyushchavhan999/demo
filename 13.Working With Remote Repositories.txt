GitHub: Working with Remote Repositories | Git Tutorials #13
Hey everyone welcome, Today we are going to learn how to work with remote repositories. So let’s get started. 

Let’s start by going to Github’s official website and creating an account. After you have created your account you need to go to the home page and click on the create a new repository option. Now give your repository a name and description. Now click on create repository. Now it will show you a page for quick setup. Now let’s make our local repository a remote repository.



 
 

Steps:
Go to your local directory and open git bash there.
Now we have 2 options, 1: If we have not created a git repository in our system then follow the first method, 2: We have a git repo in our local system we just want to push it to the remote system then follow the method 2.
We are following Method 2 Here.
So let’s copy the code on git’s website which looks like this “git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/repositoryname.git” and paste it to the git bash and press enter.
Now we will paste the second command which pushes the files onto the remote server which is “git push -u origin master”.
It will give you an error that access is denied. Now let’s tackle this.
To fix it, go to your account settings on github, then SSH and GPG keys. Then click on the new SSH key, add a title. Now for the key, open git bash and follow the simple steps.
On git bash type the following edit your email and press enter: “ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" ”
Now just simply press enter 3 times.
Now run this command “eval $(ssh-agent -s)”.
Now run this “ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa”.
Now on git bash type this to reveal your key “tail ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub”.
Now it will show you the ssh key. Just simply copy it.
And now let’s head back to the github SSH key page and paste the key to the key field, press add ssh key. And done!
Now if you run “git push -u origin master” it will run and push your files to github.
Now you can make changes on your local git repo and push the changes to the remote repo swiftly.
 

So that’s it. I hope this has cleared your doubts. Thank you for watching.
